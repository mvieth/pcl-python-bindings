# PCL Python Bindings Environment Configuration
# This file defines all paths needed for building and distributing the PCL bindings
# IMPORTANT: Update these paths to match your actual PCL and vcpkg installations

# VCPKG Configuration
# Set VCPKG_ROOT to your vcpkg installation directory
VCPKG_ROOT=C:/vcpkg
VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows

# PCL Configuration  
# Set PCL_DIR to your PCL cmake directory (where PCLConfig.cmake is located)
PCL_DIR=C:/Program Files/PCL/cmake
# Set PCL_BIN_DIR to your PCL binary directory (where PCL DLLs are located)
PCL_BIN_DIR=C:/Program Files/PCL/bin

# vcpkg Binary Directory
# Set VCPKG_BIN_DIR to your vcpkg installed packages binary directory
VCPKG_BIN_DIR=C:/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/bin

# Example alternative paths for different setups:
# Custom installation directories:
# VCPKG_ROOT=D:/tools/vcpkg
# PCL_DIR=D:/libraries/PCL/cmake
# PCL_BIN_DIR=D:/libraries/PCL/bin
# VCPKG_BIN_DIR=D:/tools/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/bin

# Linux paths (for cross-platform development):
# VCPKG_ROOT=/opt/vcpkg
# VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux
# PCL_DIR=/usr/local/lib/cmake/pcl
# PCL_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin
# VCPKG_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/lib
